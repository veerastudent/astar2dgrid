# A* Path Finding Algorithm for 2D Grid World
## AIM

To develop a code to find the route from the source to the destination point using A* algorithm for 2D grid world.

## THEORY
Explain the problem statement

## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
Build a 2D grid world with initial state , goal state and obstacles:

### STEP 2:
Create a class with the appropriate functions.


### STEP 3:
Build a 2D grid world with the initial state, goal state, and obstacles

### STEP 4:
Mention its evaluation function f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

### STEP 5:
The algorithm finds the best optimal solution.

Problems
This is the abstract class. Specific problem domains will subclass this.
class Problem(object):
    """The abstract class for a formal problem. A new domain subclasses this,
    overriding `actions` and `results`, and perhaps other methods.
    The default heuristic is 0 and the default action cost is 1 for all states.
    When yiou create an instance of a subclass, specify `initial`, and `goal` states 
    (or give an `is_goal` method) and perhaps other keyword args for the subclass."""

## OUTPUT:
![Screenshot 2022-05-18 225938](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75234790/169106114-f5bcbed2-dd6a-454b-8bfe-e4def2137d60.png)

Explain the Completeness and complexity of the algorithm: This algorithm is complete if it guarantees to return a correct answer for any arbitrary input (or, if no answer exists, it guarantees to return failure). The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic.




## RESULT:
Thus, the algorithm finds the best path to reach the final goal using Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies.
